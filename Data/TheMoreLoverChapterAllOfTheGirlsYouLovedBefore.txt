Verse 1
When you think of all the late nights
Lame fights over the phone
Wake up in themornin'with someone
But feelin'alone

Refrain
A heart is drawn around yourname
In someone's handwriting, not mine
Sneakin' out into town
Holdin' hands, justkillin'time
Pre-Chorus
Yourpast and mineare parallel lines
Starsall aligned and they intertwined
And taught you
The way you call me "baby"
Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is

Chorus
All of the girls you loved before Ooh
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

Verse 2
When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town Ooh
Cryin' in the bathroom for some dude
Whose name I cannot remember now

Refrain
Secret jokes all alone
No one's home, sixteen and wild Ooh
Breakin' up, makin' up
Leave without sayin' goodbye Ooh

And just know that
It's everything that made me
Now I call you "baby"
That's why you're so amazing

Chorus
All of the girls you loved before Ooh
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you there's good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here
I wanna teach you how forever feels like

The girls you loved before Ooh
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street Dead-end street led you straight to me Straight to me
