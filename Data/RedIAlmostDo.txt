Verse 1
I bet this time of night, youre still up
I bet youre tired from a long hard week
I bet youre sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I bet
Sometimes, you wonder 'bout me

Chorus
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I dont, I almost do, I almost do
Verse 2
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
Cause each time you reach out, theres no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I cant say hello to you and risk another goodbye

Chorus
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I dont, I almost do, I almost do

Bridge
Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
Its probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
In my dreams, youre touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do

Chorus
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I dont, I almost do, I almost do

I bet this time of night, youre still up
I bet youre tired from a long hard week
I bet youre sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I hope
Sometimes, you wonder 'bout me
