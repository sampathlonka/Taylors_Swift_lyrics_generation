Intro: JAY-Z
Is this thing on?
Oh, I thought they silenced us, Ye
Power to the people

Verse 1: JAY-Z
We livin' in that 31st century, futuristic fly shit
The penthouse is the projects and everybody flies private
New watches You know what time it is, watch us You see us
They can't stop us, the prophets, biatches!

Chorus: Kanye West, JAY-Z & Kobe
No one man should have all that power Yeah
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours Yeah
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
No one man should have all that power

Verse 2: JAY-Z
Rumble, young man, rumble
Life is a trip, so sometimes, you gon' stumble
You gotta go through pain in order to become you
But once the world numbs you, you'll feel like it's only one you
Man, you got the power to do anything you want to
Until you ask yourself, "Is this what this all comes to?"
Looking at life through sunglasses and a sunroof
But do you have the power to get out from up under you?
Fuck all these labels, fuck what everybody wants from you
They tryna Axl Rose you, welcome to the jungle
To be continued, we on that Norman Mailer shit
In search of the truth even if it goes through Taylor Swift
Tell her this!

No one man should have all that power

Bridge: Kanye West
Now when I walk in, everybody do the "Power" clap
Clap, clap, clap
Fresh for the club, I just took a half an hour nap
Clap, clap, clap
I seen people go crazy when the whole world in our lap
Clap, clap, clap
My socket was out the plug, now its time to get the power back
Clap, clap

Verse 3: Kanye West
I seen people abuse power, use power
Misuse and then lose power
Power to the people at last, its a new hour
Now we all ain't gon' be American Idols
But you could 'least grab a camera, shoot a viral
Hanh! Take the power in your own hands
Im a grown man, doing my grown dance
I dont stop until I see the end, my vision clear, bitch
Im on my Van Gogh, I dont hear shit
Chorus: Kanye West & John Legend
No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours Ey-yeah!
Oh oh And they say yeah-ey And they say
Oh oh And they say yeah-ey And they say
Oh oh And they say yeah-ey And they say
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay The power

Verse 4: Kanye West
Now everything I'm rhyming on cause a Ramadan
Been a don, praying for the families lost in the storm
Bring our troops back from Iraq, keep our troops out of Iran
So the next couple bars, I'ma drop 'em in Islam
They say "As-salamu alaykum", say "Wa alaikum as-salaam"
That's no Oscar Mayer bacon, you should run and tell your mom
Now the question is, how we gon' stop the next Vietnam
Keep Flex out of Korea, 'cause you know he drop bombs
