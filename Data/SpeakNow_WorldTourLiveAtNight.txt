Verse 1
We met back then
It was love at first sight
We did everything we could
Just to keep things right
I fell in love
With your smile
And then you fell
For my laugh
I can see in your eyes
The things youve hidden
You can see in my eyes
The pain Ive had
Through everything endured
Similarities were ensured

Chorus
So can we listen to Taylor Swift?
While having a picnic before it rains
Please snuggle up close to me
And Ill take away all your pain
Can we listen to Taylor Swift?
At night when were alone
Please snuggle up close to me
Because were in the zone
Through the music that we share
Ill make sure we always bear everything
Because of Taylor Swift

We only had two fights
About the non senses
We had to do everything
To keep us together
But those two fights
Wouldnt make things right
Between us, it was bitter
You got a job in FLA
I visit you night and day
But youre basically gone
And you made the decision
To break up with me
To set yourself free

Chorus
So can we listen to Taylor Swift?
While having a picnic before it rains
Please snuggle up close to me
And Ill take away all your pain
Can we listen to Taylor Swift?
At night when were alone
Please snuggle up close to me
Because were in the zone
Through the music that we share
Ill make sure we always bear everything
Because of Taylor Swift
Bridge
You left me out
In the cold
Whyd you do that?
It gets old
Now Im standing at your door
Lookin for our love
I cant find it anywhere
You left me in despair

Chorus
So can we listen to Taylor Swift?
While having a picnic before it rains
Please snuggle up close to me
And Ill take away all your pain
Can we listen to Taylor Swift?
At night when were alone
Please snuggle up close to me
Because were in the zone
Through the music that we share
Ill make sure we always bear everything
Because of Taylor SwiftEmbed
